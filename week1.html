				Today, I learned about Fab Lab safety, 3D printers and laser cutting machines. I now know how 
			<br>
				to ensure my safety by dressing appropriately and reading safety warning placards. Moreover, 
			<br>
				how to operate 3D printers and laser cutting machines and the pros and cons of various 3D 
			<br>
				printing and laser cutting.
			<br>
			<br>
				I was assigned to complete and pass three tests which respectively are about Fab Lab safety, 
			<br>
				3D printer and laser cutting machine. The following are evidence of me passing all three tests.
