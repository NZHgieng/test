				Today, I learned about HTML & CSS Websites. I initially thought that websites are hard to create  
			<br>
				using code but after this lesson I find it manageable to create a website. However, I also  
			<br>
				realized the hard part about creating websites. It is the style sheet. The styIe sheet affects how  
			<br>
				the website looks. A good style sheet is very hard to create for my current standard. I could only
			<br>
				try my best for now but I believe I will be able to create nice looking functional websites like the 
			<br>
				other websites out there.. I am excited that I can now create my own website. I find this skill very 
			<br>
				useful. I can use it to create a business. I can use it to create my online portfolio.  
			<br>
			<br>
				I was assigned to come up with this website for my CA1 that meets the following requirements.
