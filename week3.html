				Today, I realized the hard part about creating websites. It is the CSS style sheet that I learned 
			<br>
				today. The styIe sheet affects how the website looks. A good style sheet is very hard to create 
			<br>
				for my current standard. I could only try my best for now but I believe I will be able to create nice  
			<br>
				looking functional websites like the other websites out there.
			<br>
			<br>
				I was assigned to come up with this website for my CA1 that meets the following requirements.
